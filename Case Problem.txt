MissaTech Data Breach Impact Simulation 
Background 
MissaTech, a fast-talking software outfit known for its slick business productivity tools, had been 
climbing the ranks fast. Too fast, maybe. Somewhere between the cloud servers and the caffeine-fueled 
dev teams, someone left a door unlocked. 
Now customer data — names, numbers, the works — has slipped through the cracks. Multiple systems 
are caught in the mess: CRM, Billing, HR, Support, and Analytics. Nobody’s sure if it was negligence, 
sabotage, or just bad luck, but the fallout is real. 
The higher-ups want answers before the story hits the press. And that’s where you come in. 
Problem Statement 
MissaTech’s leadership has pulled you into the smoke-filled conference room with one job: 
figure out what happened, how bad it is, and how to make sure it doesn’t happen again. 
They need you to: 
●  Track the damage.  How much data was lost? What’s the price tag? 
●  Find the weak spots.  Which systems and regions took the hardest hit? 
The board doesn’t want guesses or gut feelings — they want numbers, charts, and cold, hard evidence. 
Scope of Work 
Teams should: 
●  Quantify the  overall business impact  of the breach using the dataset (cost, records exposed, data 
sensitivity). 
●  Identify  patterns or risk trends  , such as regions or systems that appear more frequently or have 
higher losses. 
●  Recommend  which systems or processes  should be prioritized for stronger security investment. 
●  Communicate insights clearly with  data-driven visuals and summaries  suitable for business 
leadership. 
Tasks 
1. Explore and Summarize 
●  Calculate total and average cost by  system  ,  region  , and  attack_type  . 
●  Identify the  top 3 costliest incidents  and describe their characteristics. 
●  Compute average  detection  and  response times  across systems. 
2. Visualize 
●  Create at least  two visuals 
3. Interpret and Recommend 
●  Which systems or regions caused the largest financial impact? 
●  How might faster detection or response reduce overall cost? 
●  What lessons should MissaTech learn to strengthen its data protection?
